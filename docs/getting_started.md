# Getting started

Install + first-run guide for **mlgidLAB**, the desktop GUI for the
[mlgidBASE](https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidBASE) GIWAXS pipeline.
For the pipeline-backend version policy see
[backend_compatibility.md](backend_compatibility.md). Contributor-facing
code documentation (architecture, per-module reference) lives in the
`Documentation/` tree of the development workspace.

## Requirements

- **Python ≥ 3.11** (CPython). Linux, macOS, or Windows.
- A working Qt-capable display. (Headless use is only for the test
  suite, which runs offscreen.)
- For detection / fitting / matching / raw conversion: the in-house
  pipeline stack (the `[pipeline]` extra) — see below.

mlgidLAB runs **view-only** without the pipeline stack: open and browse
NeXus files, edit peaks manually, run the in-GUI pyFAI calibration. The
Run buttons stay disabled until `[pipeline]` is installed.

## Install

A clean virtual environment is strongly recommended (the `[pipeline]`
extra pulls a large ML stack including PyTorch).

### Recommended: conda env

```bash
conda create -n mlgidlab python=3.12 -y
conda activate mlgidlab

# GUI only
pip install "git+https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidLAB@v0.1.0a7"

# or, full pipeline (detection / fitting / matching + raw conversion)
pip install "mlgidlab[pipeline] @ git+https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidLAB@v0.1.0a7"
```

### From a local clone (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidLAB
cd mlgidLAB
pip install -e ".[pipeline]"      # or -e . for view-only, -e ".[dev]" for tests
```

### Per-OS notes

- **Linux**: PySide6's offscreen/X11 plugins need a few system Qt libs
  if they're missing (`libegl1 libgl1 libglib2.0-0 libxkbcommon0
  libxcb-cursor0 libdbus-1-3 libfontconfig1` on Debian/Ubuntu). pip
  wheels bundle the rest of Qt.
- **Windows**: install into a fresh venv/conda env; the pip wheels for
  PySide6, silx, pyFAI, h5py are self-contained. No extra system libs.
- **macOS** (Intel + Apple Silicon): the same `pip install` works; the
  first launch may take a moment while Qt initializes.

The `[pipeline]` extra pins the verified-good backend versions
(`mlgidbase==0.1.3`, `pygid==0.2.10`, `pygidfit==0.1.3`,
`mlgidmatch==0.1.3`, `pygidsim==0.1.4`); bumping them is a deliberate,
test-rechecked step (see [backend_compatibility.md](backend_compatibility.md)).

## Launch

```bash
mlgidlab                 # console entry point
mlgidlab path/to/file.h5 # open a file on startup
python -m mlgidlab       # equivalent module form
```

## First-file walkthrough

1. **Open** a file: `File → Open…`, drag-and-drop, or `File → Open
   recent`. The GUI classifies it as NeXus or raw automatically. The
   right dock shows **Pipeline** for NeXus, **Conversion** for raw.
2. **Look around**: left = HDF5 tree; centre = q-image (toggle
   Cartesian / Polar); right-top = Pipeline / Conversion; right-bottom
   = Profiles / Peaks tabs; status bar = file / entry / frame / cursor.
3. **Raw → NeXus** (raw file): in the Conversion dock set PONI, mask,
   angle of incidence (the **Create…** buttons open the embedded pyFAI
   calibration), choose geometry + output, click **Convert**. The
   converted file opens automatically.
4. **Detect / fit / match** (NeXus file): Pipeline dock → **Run
   Detection** → **Run Fitting**; set a CIF source (or load the bundled
   `example/prepr_cifs.pickle`) → **Run Matching**. Overlays and the
   Peaks tables populate.
5. **Edit peaks**: click a peak to select; drag ROI edges to resize;
   `Ctrl+Alt`-drag a new manual box and **Add to fitted**. Multi-select
   detected/fitted peaks with `Ctrl+click` / `Ctrl+A`; copy/paste
   detected peaks with `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` (or `Ctrl+Shift+V` to paste
   to a frame range); **Fit selected (2D)** batch-fits; `Delete`
   removes (bulk for a multi-selection). `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z`
   undo / redo every edit.
6. **Save**: edits live on a temp copy; `File → Save` / `Save As`
   writes back. The title bar shows a `*` while there are unsaved
   changes.
7. **Export**: `Tools → Export figure…` (matplotlib) or `Export peaks
   as CSV…`.

A working sample is bundled under `example/` (`organic_labeled.h5`,
`eiger4m_0000.h5`, `prepr_cifs.pickle`).

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-|-|
| `←` / `→`, `J` / `K` | previous / next frame |
| `Home` / `End` | first / last frame |
| `Ctrl+click`, `Ctrl+A` | multi-select detected/fitted peaks |
| `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` | copy / paste detected peaks |
| `Ctrl+Shift+V` | paste detected peaks to a frame range |
| `Delete` | delete selected peak(s) |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (or `Ctrl+Y`) | undo / redo |
| `Ctrl+F` | find peak by id |
| `F1` | controls & shortcuts reference |
| `F11` | fullscreen image viewer |

## Troubleshooting

- **Run buttons are disabled / "view-only"**: the `[pipeline]` extra
  isn't installed. `pip install "mlgidlab[pipeline] @ git+…"`.
- **Qt / "could not load platform plugin"** on Linux: install the
  system Qt libs listed above.
- **An operation seems to do nothing**: check the **Logs** dock — some
  calibration/worker errors are logged there rather than shown as a
  dialog.
- **Matching returns no solutions**: confirm the CIF source loaded for
  the active entry (multi-energy files parse CIFs per entry).
