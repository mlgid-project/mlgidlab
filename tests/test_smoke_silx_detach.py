"""Smoke harness — workstream C: the `_detached_silx_tree` CM.

`test_smoke_session.test_save_writes_back_and_clears_dirty` had to
stamp the *original* file out-of-band because the viewer's FrameSource
holds `temp_path` open read-only and h5py refuses an in-process `r+`
reopen — the exact silx/h5py coupling C's context manager exists to
manage. These are the positive-path proof: inside
`with main_window._detached_silx_tree():` the working copy *is*
writable, and on exit (normal or exception) the FrameSource is
reacquired so the viewer keeps working.

    conftest sets ``HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE`` (a second handle
