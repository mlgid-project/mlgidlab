"""``_pipeline_queue`` must carry an explicit per-command file_path
snapshotted at enqueue time, so a mid-queue active-session switch
can't dispatch later commands against the wrong file.

Regression: with two files loaded, hitting "All entries" → Run on
file A expanded into N commands but each command read
``self.session.temp_path`` fresh at dispatch. If the active session
flipped to file B between commands, later commands dispatched
against B, and the entry pre-flight tripped with a misleading
message naming B's available entries.
