"""Smoke harness — workstream A, increment 1: construction + teardown.

The riskiest path in mlgidLAB is the ``MainWindow`` constructor itself:
it wires the silx tree, the image viewer, seven docks and six menus,
and that coupling is exactly what every feature has had to tiptoe
around. Zero fixture data is needed to exercise it, so it is the
highest-value first net: "does the app start, and does it shut down
cleanly without a session loaded".

Later A increments add synthetic-file open/frame/save tests once the
FrameSource HDF5 schema is mapped.
