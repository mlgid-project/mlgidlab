"""Regression: the viewer must not raise ``RuntimeError("FrameSource
not acquired")`` when the user interacts with the plot during the
silx detach/reattach window (pipeline run, ROI commit, Add-to-fitted,
clear-peaks, save-as), where the FrameSource's h5py handle is closed.

Two interaction paths reach a released FrameSource:

1. Moving the cursor over the polar plot -> ``_compute_cursor_info``
   indexes the cached ``_LazyPolarStack``, which delegates into
   ``FrameSource.get_polar`` and raises on a closed handle. The
   ``_polar_cache is None`` guard alone is insufficient because a
   release path can leave the cache tuple in place while the source
   is closed; the lookup must additionally require ``is_open``.

2. Toggling the Cartesian/Polar radio -> ``set_mode`` ->
   ``_render_active_mode`` -> ``_build_*_params`` reads frame 0 through
   the FrameSource for robust levels. ``_render_active_mode`` must bail
   when the source is released and let ``acquire_frame_source``
   re-render once the handle reopens.
