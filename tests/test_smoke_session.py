"""Smoke harness — workstream A, increment 2: session lifecycle.

Drives the most-used path with a synthetic NeXus file and no heavy
backend: open -> populate entries -> step frames -> save -> close.
Verified against source that none of this touches mlgidbase/pygid
(those are imported lazily only in ``pipeline.py`` when a pipeline
command runs), so the suite stays decoupled from the heavy stack.

The open is driven through ``_set_active_session`` directly rather
than ``_open_paths``: the latter queues a ``CopyWorker`` thread and
spawns a modal ``QProgressDialog``, which would hang an offscreen
run. ``_set_active_session`` is the fully synchronous orchestrator it
ultimately feeds (``_populate_entries`` ->
``_load_entry_into_viewer`` -> ``viewer.show_stack``), so calling it
exercises the same load logic deterministically.
