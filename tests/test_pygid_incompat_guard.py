"""Pre-flight guard: pipeline.execute refuses files pygid can't open.

``pygid.NexusFile.read_structure`` iterates *every* top-level group and
unconditionally indexes ``root[f"/{entry}/data"]``
(``pygid/nexus_reader.py::get_entry_type``). A single raw-style or
stray-metadata top-level group therefore brings down the whole
``mlgidBASE`` open with an opaque h5py ``KeyError``. The fix lives in
``file_model.list_pygid_incompatible_top_level`` (detection) and
``pipeline.execute`` (pre-flight RuntimeError). These tests pin the
contract: the detector flags the same group set pygid would crash on,
and the pipeline never reaches mlgidBASE when bad groups exist.
