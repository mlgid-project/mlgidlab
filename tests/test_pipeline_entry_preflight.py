"""Pre-flight check: ``pipeline.execute`` must reject a stale or
nonexistent ``entry`` kwarg with a clear RuntimeError naming the
available entries — *before* mlgidBASE / pygidfit gets invoked and
raises its opaque ``ValueError("entry not found in the NeXus
file")`` from deep inside ``ProcessDataFromFile``.

The bug this guards against: the entry combo can carry a stale name
across a file modification (entry deleted externally, or the
selection survived a file swap). pygidfit then raises a message
naming neither the picked entry nor the actually-available ones, so
the user has to inspect the file manually to recover.
