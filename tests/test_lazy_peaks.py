"""Per-frame peaks load lazily, not all up front.

`_load_entry_into_viewer` used to loop over every frame of an entry
loading detected/fitted/matched peaks synchronously — hundreds of HDF5
opens per entry switch on a many-frame entry, a big part of the lag.
Now only the frame the viewer lands on is loaded; other frames load on
demand when navigated to (`_on_viewer_frame_changed` → `_load_frame_peaks`).
