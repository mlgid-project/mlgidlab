"""In-memory peak clipboard, scoped to the source entry.

Backs the Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V workflow for detected peaks. Same-entry only:
``take_items`` returns ``[]`` when the caller's target entry doesn't
match the entry the items were copied from. This avoids cross-instrument
mistakes (different q-axis ranges, different geometry) without making
the host carry the conditional.

Not a Qt clipboard — paste must be byte-exact polar coords, and we
don't want interop with other apps' text clipboards. Single module-
level snapshot; ``set_items`` overwrites whatever was there.
