class PrefetchWorker(QObject):
    """Background filler for the FrameSource's per-frame LRU caches.

    Lives on its own ``QThread``. Owns an **independent**
    ``h5py.File`` handle so cross-thread h5py access doesn't share
    state with the main thread's ``FrameSource``. Reads one
    Cartesian frame, computes its polar resample, and emits both to
    the main thread; the main thread then deposits the result into
    the FrameSource's LRU via ``warm_cartesian`` / ``warm_polar``.

    The worker walks frames ahead of the current play-head using a
    **sliding window**: prefetches up to ``window`` frames forward
    of ``head``, pauses when caught up, restarts when ``head``
    advances. ``window`` is set by the host to ``LRU_size - 1`` so
    the prefetcher never overflows the LRU (which would evict
    frames the play-head still needs to reach).

    The internal QTimer ticks at 15 ms and prefetches **one frame
    per tick** — yields between frames so other Qt work on the
    worker's thread (signal delivery, shutdown) doesn't starve.

    Lifecycle slots (all run on the worker's thread via queued
    connections from the host):

    - ``configure(file_path, entry, n_frames, window)`` — (re)open
      the h5py handle for a new entry. Clears the ``_done`` set.
    - ``update_state(head, active, step)`` — push the current play-
      head, the active flag, and the playback frame-stride. Starts /
      stops the internal timer. ``step > 1`` means the host is
      skipping frames during playback (sub-50 ms requested interval);
      the worker walks the same stride so it doesn't prefetch frames
      the player will skip.
    - ``release()`` — close the h5py handle. Called when MainWindow
      detaches silx for a pipeline run.
